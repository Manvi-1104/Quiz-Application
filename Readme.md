Quiz Application:

We are developing a Python quiz application with a Tkinter-based frontend and a MySQL backend. The application offers quizzes in four distinct domains, each comprising 30 questions. Players complete the quiz, and upon completion, their final scores, along with other player details, are recorded in the scoreboard table within the backend database.


Steps to execute:
1. Create scoreboard table in mySQL in the Quiz database with the required attributes.
2. Run the mainA.py file
